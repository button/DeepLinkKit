 - NSDictionary and NSArray will call `DPLJSONObject' on all of their items.
 - Objects in an NSDictionary not keyed by an NSString will be removed.
 - NSNumbers that are NaN or Inf will be represented by a string.
 - NSDate objects will be represented as `timeIntervalSinceReferenceDate'.
 - JSON incompatible objects will return their description.
 - All NSNulls will be removed because who wants an NSNull.
