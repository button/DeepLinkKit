 A base class for handling routes. 
 
 While it's easy to just register block route handlers, some of your routes might require
 a bit more work resulting a mess of code in your block handler. Creating a `DPLRouteHandler'
 subclass helps move that complexity from route registration to a more sensible place.
 
 @note Subclasses of `DPLRouteHandler' have two rules, they MUST specify a target view controller 
 and they must conform to the `DPLTargetViewController' protocol. You can provide a view controller 
 by overriding `targetViewController'.
